# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

getLowerBound : replaced double return with 0.0d for org/jfree/data/Range::getLowerBound -> KILLED

getCentralValue : Substituted 2.0 with 1.0 -> KILLED 
<br/>This mutant was killed because  

getCentralValue : Replaced double addition with subtraction -> KILLED

shift : removed call to org/jfree/data/util/ParamChecks::nullNotPermitted -> SURVIVED

contains : greater than to less or equal -> KILLED

min : removed conditional - replaced equality check with false -> SURVIVED

expandToInclude : greater or equal to greater than -> SURVIVED

expand : removed call to org/jfree/data/Range::getLength -> KILLED

shiftWithNoZeroCrossing : Substituted 0.0 with 1.0 -> SURVIVED

equals : replaced boolena return with false for org/jfree/data/Range::equals -> KILLED
