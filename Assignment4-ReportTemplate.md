# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

### getLowerBound : replaced double return with 0.0d for org/jfree/data/Range::getLowerBound -> KILLED


### getCentralValue : Substituted 2.0 with 1.0 -> KILLED 
<br/>This mutant was killed because  

### getCentralValue : Replaced double addition with subtraction -> KILLED

### shift : removed call to org/jfree/data/util/ParamChecks::nullNotPermitted -> SURVIVED

### contains : greater than to less or equal -> KILLED

### min : removed conditional - replaced equality check with false -> SURVIVED

### expandToInclude : greater or equal to greater than -> SURVIVED

### expand : removed call to org/jfree/data/Range::getLength -> KILLED

### shiftWithNoZeroCrossing : Substituted 0.0 with 1.0 -> SURVIVED

### equals : replaced boolena return with false for org/jfree/data/Range::equals -> KILLED


# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
Our test case design process involved identifying key functionalities of the system, such as longing in and purchasing items, then writing test which verify the system is running properly.


# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
Assertions are used to make sure the system ends in the correct state. Checkpoints are used for when longer paths must be taken, ensuring that the correct paths are being taken prior to running specified tests.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data


# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix


# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Each of us created 2 test cases using selenium.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned


# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Interesting lab in which we explore how to use mutation testing in order to improve our test suite. Also, selenium seems like a powerful tool that can be even used outside of testing when needing to automate website interactions.
